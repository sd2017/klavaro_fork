2009-08-02 Felipe Castro (-) <fefcas@gmail.com>

	* Release 1.2.2
	* Added:
	- New kind of exercise in the adaptability module: character salad based on the error profile
	of the user. In order to reach that, the user should practice a little bit, accumulating more than
	200 errors (but not from the basic module, because they aren't accumulated there).
	- The colected errors are shown in the adaptability charts.
	- Double spaces after full stops are generated if the option 'double_spaces=true' is present
	in the section [tutor] of the 'preferences.ini' file; this affects only the fluidity module.
	- The colors of the blinking cursor may be modified through the 'preferences.ini' file. The
	format is like #FFFFFF for white and #000000 for black (RGB format). The variables are in the
	section [colors] and they are 'cursor_blink_bg' and 'cursor_blink_fg'.
	* Changed:
	- WPM calculation: new_WPM = 1.2 * old_WPM (so if you typed 50 WPM, now it will be 60 WPM!);
	but CPS wasn't affected.
	- In the fluidity module, the cursor blinks inverted, so that it will disappear if the user
	types fast and accurately, in a more natural way, closer to real typing.
	- User data now goes into the $XDG_DATA_HOME subdir ($HOME/.local/share/klavaro),
	but user configuration files remain in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME.
	- Eliminated scores from the /var/games subdir, so those data spread in the users' home dirs.
	- Accepting <ENTER> in place of spaces, due to the (GTK) "bug" that hides the cursor at
	the automatic line breakings (GTK justification eats the spaces at the ending of broken lines).
	- Comments for poor performance are not done, the user just gets an unhappy smiley :-( 
	* Fixed:
	- Velocity x Accuracy (mis)evaluation in the fluidness module.
