Yet just when a young generation enamored of technology might be tempted to think that putting pen to paper is hopelessly quaint, they're getting scattered reminders that the written word remains important. High school students who take the scholastic test must now write a short essay. The exercise measures students' ability to organize and express ideas clearly and to follow the conventions of standard written English.

In an age when mailboxes bulge with a daily barrage of junk mail, the sight of a hand-addressed envelope with a first-class stamp is cause for rejoicing. And perhaps who better to engage the youngest generation in occasional written exchanges than grandparents? Letters can connect generations and strengthen family bonds. They also offer an easy way to give children experience in writing. Even a casual letter involves organizing thoughts and ideas.

Every year, our world seems smaller. Ships carry a thousand items between countries. Jets carry passengers across oceans and around the world. Satellites bring us live television coverage from Europe and Asia. Every year, Americans in every walk of life communicate more and more with people of other countries. As a result of this tremendous increase in contacts with the outside world, Americans are realizing that there is still a major barrier to international communication -- the language barrier!

Americans have long heard the cliche that "Wherever you go, people speak English." In fact, at most ten percent of the world speaks English! Often, in other countries, only people in the best hotels of the largest cities can use English, and even they are often not very fluent. Anyone who has visited a foreign country and struggled with the language barriers understands this. Americans are at last discovering what the rest of the world has long known: there is a real need for an international language.

The second major reason for Esperanto's success is that it is neutral. It belongs to no one country. Many people in America and England say that English is already spoken so widely and is such an "important" language in the world that it should be officially adopted by all nations as the international language. This view is very unpopular in many countries.

A body substitute replaces the credited actor of a character in any recorded visual medium in shots where the character's body is shown but the face is either not visible or shown indistinctly, or in shots where the image of the credited actor's face is joined to the image of the body double's body. Usually, the double's face is kept from being seen on camera. This way the lead actor can work in fewer scenes and can apparently be filming in two scenes at once.

The least expensive forms of entertainment programming genres are game shows, talk shows, variety shows, and reality television. Game shows feature contestants answering questions and solving puzzles to win prizes. Talk shows contain interviews with film, television, and music celebrities and public figures. Variety shows feature a range of musical performers and other entertainers, such as comedians and magicians, introduced by a host or master of ceremonies.

While advertising can be seen as necessary for economic growth, it is not without social costs. Unsolicited commercial e-mail and other forms of spam have become so prevalent as to have become a major nuisance to users of these services, as well as being a financial burden on internet service providers. Advertising is increasingly invading public spaces, such as schools, which some critics argue is a form of child exploitation.

Don't judge a man until you have walked a mile in his boots. Half a loaf is better than no bread. If you buy quality, you only cry once. All cats love fish but hate to get their paws wet. The child is father to the man and to the woman. Counsel is no command. Common sense is not so common. A man is known by the company he keeps. Dogs wags their tails, not as much to you as to your bread.

Flutes may be open at one or both ends. Open-ended such as the concert one and the recorder have more harmonics, and thus more flexibility for the player, and brighter timbres. An organ pipe may be either open or closed, depending on the sound desired. The instrument may have any number of pipes or tubes, though one is the most common number.

Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise. Eat your own dog food. You always find something in the last place you look. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. You must not run after two hares at the same time. The heart sees farther than the head. If you're in a hole, stop digging. A lie can be halfway around the world before the truth gets its boots on.

Dreams are successions of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations that occur involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep. The content and purpose of dreams are not definitively understood, though they have been a topic of scientific speculation, as well as a subject of philosophical and religious interest, throughout recorded history.

Lucid dreaming is the conscious perception of one's state while dreaming. In this state the dreamer may often (but not always) have some degree of control over their own actions within the dream or even the characters and the environment of the dream. Dream control has been reported to improve with practiced deliberate lucid dreaming. The occurrence of lucid dreaming has been scientifically verified.

The software enables users to synthesize singing by typing in lyrics and melody. It uses synthesizing technology with specially recorded vocals of voice actors or singers. To create a song, the user must input the melody and lyrics. A piano roll type interface is used to input the melody and the lyrics can be entered on each note. The software can change the stress of the pronunciations, add effects such as vibrato, or change the dynamics and tone of the voice.

The use of any keyboard may cause serious injury to hands, wrists, arms, neck or back. The risks of injuries can be reduced by taking frequent short breaks to get up and walk around a couple of times every hour. As well, users should vary tasks throughout the day, to avoid overuse of the hands and wrists. When inputting at the keyboard, a person should keep the shoulders relaxed with the elbows at the side, with the keyboard and mouse positioned so that reaching is not necessary.

Speech recognition converts speech into machine-readable text (that is, a string of character codes). This technology has also reached an advanced state and is implemented in various software products. For certain uses (transcription of medical or legal dictation; journalism; writing essays or novels) speech recognition is starting to replace the keyboard. However, the lack of privacy when issuing voice commands and dictation makes this kind of input unsuitable for many environments.

A general theory of cookies may be formulated this way. Despite its descent from cakes and other sweetened breads, the cookie in almost all its forms has abandoned water as a medium for cohesion. Water in cakes serves to make the base (in the case of cakes called "batter") as thin as possible, which allows the bubbles - responsible for a cake's fluffiness - to better form. In the cookie, the agent of cohesion has become some form of oil.

Lasagne are a wide, flat pasta shape, and possibly one of the oldest types of pasta. The word also refers to a dish made with several layers of lasagne sheets alternated with sauces and various other ingredients. It is common to find lasagne made with mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, various meats, miscellaneous vegetables, mushrooms and typically flavored with wine, garlic, onion, and oregano.

Despite the honey bee's painful sting and the stereotype of insects as pests, bees are generally held in high regard. This is most likely due to their usefulness as pollinators and as producers of honey, their social nature, and their reputation for diligence. They are one of the few insects frequently used in advertisements in a positive manner, typically for products containing honey.

One of the main purposes of dating is for two or more people to evaluate one another's suitability as a long term companion. Often physical characteristics, personality, financial status, and other aspects of the involved persons are judged and as a result feelings can be hurt, and confidence shaken. Because of the uncertainty of the whole situation, the desire to be acceptable to the other person, and the possibility of rejection, dating can be very stressful for all parties involved.
